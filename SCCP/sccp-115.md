## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SCCP proposes to increase the cap on the wrappr contract to 100k ETH from 75k ETH.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

With the contract currently being near saturation with eth, this sccp proposes to increase the cap to 100k ETH.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The cap increase is to allow for arbers to continue to take advantage of the wrappr contract in order to mint sETH with ETH and align the pegs during periods of excess demand without hitting the cap.
