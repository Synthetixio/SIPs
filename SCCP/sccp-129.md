## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Increase exchange fees for s1INCH, sCOMP, and sCRV.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

This SCCP proposes to increase exchange fees for $1INCH, $COMP, and $CRV to 300 bp.  

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Global liquidity for $1INCH, $COMP, and $CRV is lower than for that of other assets supported on Synthetix. For very large trades, stakers are currently providing liquidity for these assets that does not exist in the broader market, which can expose SNX stakers to undo risk and higher hedging costs. This SCCP proposes to increase exchange fees on these synths such that the cost of large trades more closely reflects current market conditions, while still providing far better trade execution than any other venue.
