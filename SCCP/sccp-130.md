## Simple Summary

Raise fees on exchanges into sCRV, sAAVE, sRUNE, sCOMP, sYFI and s1INCH to 300 bp from 100 bp.

## Motivation

Analysis of on-chain data showed that low liquidity market conditions and the wider availablity of synths (due to wrappr) has allowed certain actors to take up sizeable slippage-less positions in defi beyound what is deemed reasonable on CEX and DEX's.
This SCCP proposes to raise fees on these tokens to 300 bp, as a stopgap measure, until other sips such as [that proposed on supply caps](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-146) are ready for deployment.
