## Simple Summary

This STP allocates 5k SNX to existing perp front ends, to kick start onboarding traders during the public alpha.

## Abstract

Allocate 2.5k SNX each to Kwenta and Polynomial, to attract traders to Perps v3 on Base Andromdeda.

## Motivation

Perps v3 is ready scale up, and requires more trading activity in its currently limited state of 1m OI for BTC and ETH. 

## Specification

### Overview

This STP allocates 5k SNX to the existing perp front ends, to be used to rebate or incentivize traders on Base Perps v3. SNX will be distributed by Kwenta and Polynomial, and must be directly attributable to trading activity on Base Perps v3 with the current 1m OI caps.

### Rationale
The currently limited OI caps make testing less attractive, but incentives is expected to encourage trading, which in turn enables OI caps to be lifted with more confidence.


### Financial Specification

Send 2.5k SNX to each of Polynomial and Kwenta treasury multisigs.
