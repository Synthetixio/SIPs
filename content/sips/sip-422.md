## Simple Summary

Introduce a debt-free staking mechanism for SNX holders on mainnet that distributes 5 million SNX in rewards over 1 year. Users can unstake at any time, but earned rewards are subject to a time-based penalty if they exit before the end of the program. 

## Abstract

This SIP proposes a new SNX staking initiative designed to be simple, transparent, and flexible. Users stake SNX and earn rewards pro-rata over 1 year. If users unstake before the program concludes, a penalty is applied to their earned rewards, starting at 100% and decreasing linearly to 0% throughout the staking period.

The penalty system incentivizes long-term alignment while allowing liquidity at any time. Forfeited rewards will remain undistributed the Treasury.

## Motivation

Historically, SNX staking required users to manage sUSD debt, creating complexity and friction. With the launch of the 420 Pool and protocol-managed debt, there is an opportunity to offer a simple, flexible staking mechanism to engage passive SNX holders during the transition to Synthetix V4.

This initiative provides yield to SNX holders without the burden of debt, encourages long-term participation, and ensures Treasury recapture of forfeited rewards in case of early exit.

## Specification

### Staking Mechanics

- **Network:** Ethereum Mainnet
- **Token:** SNX
- **Program Duration:** 1 year
- **Reward Pool:** 5,000,000 SNX
- **Reward Emission Rate:** 5,000,000 SNX ÷ 31,536,000 seconds ≈ 0.**15844 SNX/second**
- **Eligibility:** All wallets that deposit SNX into the staking contract.
- **Entry/Exit Flexibility:** Users can deposit or withdraw SNX at any time with a 7-day cooldown period. Principal SNX is never penalized; only earned rewards are subject to penalties.

### Penalty Mechanism on Early Withdrawal

- **Applies to:** Earned SNX rewards only (not principal stake).
- **Penalty Rate:**
    - Starts at 100% penalty at program launch.
    - Decreases linearly.
    - At program conclusion (after 1 year), penalty = 0%.
- **Penalty Formula:**
    - Penalty % = 100% - (second_number / 31,449,600) * 100%
- **Examples:**
- Withdrawal at week 13 → 75% penalty.
- Withdrawal at week 26 → ~50% penalty.
- Withdrawal at week 39 → ~25% penalty.
- Withdrawal at week 52 → 0% penalty.
- **Penalty Destination:** Forfeited SNX via early exit will remain with the Treasury.

## Rationale

This mechanism offers several key benefits:

- **Simplicity:** Users no longer manage debt or complex vesting mechanics.
- **Flexibility:** Users can exit at any time, with clear penalty-based consequences.
- **Transparency:** The penalty rate is predictable and easy to display on UI.
- **Treasury Alignment:** Early exit penalties return value directly to the Treasury.

It creates a smooth glidepath toward long-term SNX holding without locking users into rigid structures.

## Technical Specification

### Smart Contract Requirements

- Accept SNX deposits and enable withdrawals.
- Track user's deposit amount and cumulative rewards.
- Calculate linear rewards based on proportional stake.
- Apply a withdrawal penalty to earned rewards based on the current program week.

### Configurable Parameters

- Total emissions distributed over 1 year
- Ability to pause deposits or withdrawals (emergency powers)

## Test Cases

1. **Full Term Completion:**
- User deposits on day 0.
- User withdraws after 52 weeks.
- No penalty applied; user receives full earned rewards.
1. **Midway Exit:**
- User deposits on day 0.
- User withdraws after 26 weeks.
- 50% penalty applied to earned rewards.
1. **Late Entry, Early Exit:**
- User deposits at week 10.
- Withdraws at week 39.
- Penalty based on week 39 (25%) applied to all earned rewards.

## Reference Implementation

Staking will occur via the existing `TreasuryMarket` contract. Reward logic will be calculated offchain. 

## Security Considerations

- Ensure accurate calculation of user rewards and penalties.
- Protect against manipulation of withdrawal timing or re-entry exploits.
- Conduct security audit prior to deployment.
- Provide monitoring tools for Treasury inflows from forfeited penalties.
