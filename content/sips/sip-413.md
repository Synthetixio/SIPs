## Simple Summary

This SIP proposes the addition of WETH, wstETH, cbETH, and cbBTC tokens as LP collateral on Base V3 deployment.

## Abstract

In order to enhance the diversity of yield-generation and exposure options for LP collateral within the Synthetix ecosystem, this SIP aims to add WETH, wstETH, cbETH, and cbBTC tokens as LP collateral on Base V3 deployment. 

## Motivation

1. **Capital Efficiency**: Expand use cases for WETH, wstETH, cbETH, and cbBTC holders, letting them earn yield while retaining exposure to underlying yields.  
2. **Diversification**: Incorporate multiple types of ETH- and BTC-based derivatives to spread risk.  
3. **Ecosystem Growth on Base**: Attract additional users and liquidity through widely recognized “blue-chip” derivatives.
4. **Arbitrum Match**: Provide a home for wstETH and WETH Arbitrum LPs on Base.

### Technical Specification

None of these LP assets should be eligibile for minting snxUSD against deposits.

### Test Cases

N/A

### Configurable Values

Each LP parameter (LP cap, liquidation ratio, etc) will be configured via SCCP.
