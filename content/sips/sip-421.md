## Simple Summary

This SIP proposes a 12-month sUSD staking initiative, distributing 5 million SNX to incentivize sUSD sinks while also aligning protocol health with the ongoing Debt Jubilee. This aims to reduce sUSD circulating supply and ensure that SNX stakers participating in the Jubilee maintain skin in the game via a defined sUSD:Original Debt ratio.

## Abstract

With the Debt Jubilee effectively removing solo staker's sUSD debt repayment requirement, sUSD has lost a peg stability mechanism. To reinforce sUSD peg stability while still achieving SIP-420's objective of transfering solo staker debt to the protocol, this SIP introduces a mechanism and incentive program that:

- Distributes 5m SNX pro-rata to sUSD stakers over 12 months (starting April 19, 2025).
- Requires SNX stakers participating in the Jubilee to maintain a configurable sUSD:Original Debt ratio.
- Enforces locking of sUSD until the end of the program unless used to repay SNX debt.
- Applies a 3-month linear unlock to earned SNX rewards following the program’s conclusion.

## Motivation

The Debt Jubilee offered SNX stakers a path to debt freedom without requiring any peg maintencance and stability incentives. While well-intentioned, this created an imbalance: Jubilee participants could fully exit any sUSD holdings during the transition phase  sUSD suffered from a lack of demand.

This SIP restores equilibrium by giving sUSD a purpose again — via staking rewards — and ensuring that Jubilee participants are actively participating in sUSD peg stability.

## Specification

### sUSD Staking Mechanism

- **Duration:** 12 months from April 19, 2025 to April 19, 2026.
- **Rewards:** 5,000,000 SNX distributed via time-weighted deposits.
- **Unlock:** SNX rewards will vest over 3 months linearly, starting April 19, 2026.
- **Eligibility:** All wallets that deposit sUSD into the staking contract.
- **Lockup:** Deposited sUSD is locked until April 19, 2026 (adjustable via governance).
- **Pro-rata distribution:** Rewards scale based on share of total staked sUSD.

### Debt Jubilee Conditions

- **Minimum Ratio:** SNX stakers with debt must maintain a configurable sUSD:Original Debt ratio (e.g., 1:10) to preserve Jubilee progress.
- **Grace Period:** Stakers will have 2 weeks post-launch to meet the ratio. Failure to comply resets their Jubilee clock.
- **Monitoring:** Ratio is checked continuously. If a staker falls below, the Jubilee timer pauses (not resets) until restored.
- **Adjustment:** Governance can update the required sUSD:Debt ratio. New conditions apply retroactively; users must increase sUSD to resume their Jubilee.
- **Repayment Exception:** Users must be able to withdraw sUSD to repay debt and exit staking (future enhancement).

## Rationale

By pairing SNX incentives with sUSD locks, we both create a near-term sink for sUSD and reinforce the spirit of the Jubilee program: long-term alignment between SNX stakers and protocol health.

The 3-month vesting period post-incentive dampens potential SNX sell pressure as liquid SNX earned from the program is released over time.

## Technical Specification

- **Contract Updates:** A new sUSD staking contract must be deployed with reward distribution, lock-up, and vesting logic.
- **Ratio Tracking:** A new mechanism must track the sUSD:Debt ratio per SNX staker and interface with Jubilee timers.
- **Configurable Parameters:**
    - Jubilee minimum ratio
    - Lock duration
    - Reward emissions rate
    - Post-distribution vesting duration
