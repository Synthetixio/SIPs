<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor.

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes the creation of staking accounts in Version 3 of the Synthetix protocol. Users can mint an NFT which represents their account and delegate specific permissions for this account to other addresses.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Account tokens are transferrable ERC-721 tokens which are functionally similar to user accounts in traditional authentication and authorization systems. These accounts represent stakers and are not relevant to the traders interacting with markets powered by the protocol.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Currently, stakers are unable to transfer their position in the Synthetix protocol between wallets without exiting the system and re-entering. This is a poor user experience and can be gas intensive. With account tokens, a user could simply transfer ownership between the two wallets, as they would any other NFT. By decoupling accounts and addresses, this pattern allows us to create clean abstractions for delegation and authorization functionality.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

When someone begins staking in the Synthetix protocol, they will be minted an snxAccount token. All aspects of the protocol that would otherwise reference a staker by their address should instead reference an account ID. Account owners may also delegate specific permissions to additional addresses. All collateral staked in the system is associated with an account.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Representing stakers as tokens allows us to create a variety of abstractions related to ownership and permissions which significantly improve user experience. By implementing the ERC-721 standard, we can maximize composability with smart contracts and existing user interfaces. This could also allow for a secondary market to be created for account tokens, which may have interesting side effects.

Also, by adding more robust delegation functionality, stakers can practice improved operational security. For example, a hardware wallet may own an account with permission for claiming rewards delegated to a software wallet. If the software wallet were compromised, the attacker would only be able to claim outstanding rewards for the account (and not, for example, unstake all of the account’s collateral).

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

Accounts will implement the ERC-721 standard as well as the following functions:

```solidity
interface IAccount is IERC721 {
	function mint(uint requestedAccountId, address owner);
	function hasRole(uint accountId, bytes32 role, address target) external view returns (bool);
	function grantRole(uint accountId, bytes32 role, address target) external;
	function revokeRole(uint accountId, bytes32 role, address target) external;
	function renounceRole(uint accountId, bytes32 role, address target) external;
}
```

The roles that are supported by accounts will be specified as functionality is added. This will entail actions like staking, unstaking, minting, burning, claiming rewards, modifying others’ roles, etc.

Fundamentally, the protocol associates all staked collateral with an account, so accounts will be specific to the network where staked collateral is held. In other words, we don't anticipate building functionality for transferring accounts tokens cross-chain. Any cross-chain functionality pertaining to accounts will need to specify relevant account IDs (in addition to the relevant chain IDs) where necessary.

The governance module will need to include support for voters to be represented by account IDs rather than addresses (either in future iterations or with peripheral contracts). It will also need to confirm that any users attempting to vote has appropriate permissions in relation to the account ID that they specify.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Relevant tests will be developed during implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
