## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes to put in place the following action plan that unwinds part of the negative ETH skew (currently at 230m$):

- Create a DAI/sUSD with the following parameters:

  a) 0 `mintingFeeRate`, 

  b) 1% `burnFeeRate`

  c) 100m sUSD `maxTokenAmount`

- The DAI wrappr will enable graceful unwind of the negative skew by market forces or willing participants with the following strategy:
 
  a) Mint sUSD with DAI or acquire it from the market if it is a cheaper option
  
  b) Buy sETH with sUSD
  
  c) Swap the sETH to ETH
  
  d) Swap ETH to DAI 
  
  e) Go back to step(a)

- At a later date, when the LUSD Supply catches up with the demand on Ethereum, in another SIP, the following can be implemented to unwind the DAI:

  a) Buy LUSD with with DAI

  b) Mint sUSD with LUSD

  c) Burn the sUSD to release the DAI

  d) go back to step(a)

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The negative implications from the current negative ETH Skew on the debt pool are as follows:
  - The negative ETH skew requires that snx stakers take out short ETH / long BTC to hedge their debt which is an unpleasant un-intuitive experience. 
  - The decrease in snx price has resulted in a significantly larger portion of the debt pool on the ethereum network is originating from the ETH wrappr. This results in increased leverage position which exposes stakers to significant price volatility and requires around 2x the amount of active debt in order to implement an effective hedge.
  - The upcoming debt-pool synthesis will result in snx stakers on optimism needing to hedge their staked snx and account for the implications noted above.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Replacing the wrapped ETH with a stablecoin will lead to a much more stable debt pool, requiring less effort on minters for managing their debt. Although it would have been preferable to utilize LUSD as the stable-coin of choice to grow the protocol, unfortunately the supply of LUSD hasn't kept up with market demand given it's persistent premium, while the urgency of taking action to counter the the negative ETH skew is significantly larger as debt-pool synthetis and SNX-V3 nears.  

*Key Risk Factor:*

Key risk to consider is that by backing the debt pool with DAI/LUSD, the protocol takes on the contract, credit and censorship risk (DAI) associated with the Maker and Liquity protocols. However, given that the LUSD/DAI is locked on L1 (as opposite the optimism) the credit risk is significantly more manageable as it can be unlocked atomically for liquidations purposes.
Furthermore, it is important to denote that the censorship risk is temporary, as the parameters of the DAI wrappr will be adjusted by reducing the `burnFeeRate` and the capacity to zero to gracefully unwind it in favor of LUSD.

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
N/A

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
N/A

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

N/A

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

N/A

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
