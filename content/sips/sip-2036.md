## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This sip proposes to incorporate a reversion into the weekly inflation mint, if the weekly distribution to L2 stakers fails.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The `RewardsDistribution` contract currently ignores errors when it attempts to send out the configured snx distributions. This leads to a situation, where the L2 supply is minted and is not relayed to L2, due to insufficient gas. This SIP incorporates a revert into the `RewardsDistribution` contract in case the relay to optimism fails.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

In reference to [SCCP-2051](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-2051), as can be seen in the [minting transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9db69f2f9d9782e003eae79da083088355d2729a123e3897bf5a3f1a46072832) the inflation destined for L2 were printed, but were never relayed over to optimism. This is because of a check by the optimism's [ResourceMetering.sol](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/ac2df11b30aca5cb95fc823ddc8966bd1a570c0e/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/ResourceMetering.sol#L144) that asserts that a transaction's gas limit exceeds a minimum, the latter depends on the length of the contract call.

This SIP proposes to incorporate a revert, that throws the entire minting transaction in case the distribution of rewards to L2 stakers fails. Hence, keeper would be incentivized to boost the gas limit to the point where the transaction doesn't revert in order to earn the subsidized 100 snx per week in keeping fee. 

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

The fix entails reverting the inflation mint transaction, if a programmed distribution fails to sucessfully execute, in the [`RewardsDistribution.sol`](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/pull/2160/files#diff-31f3ee2aa3dfdba395e7dfb288545f20085d1e41053e64a009981a5edab44256R175) contract. 

It is worth mentioning as a consequence of this fix, all future contracts that would receive snx distributions, will need  to implement a `notifyReward` in the receiving contract, otherwise the distribution and weekly inflation print will fail. Currently, as per the state of the v2X contracts, at the time of writing this sip, no contracts are configured to receive snx inflation on a weekly basis, aside from [`SynthetixBridgeToOptimism.sol`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x39Ea01a0298C315d149a490E34B59Dbf2EC7e48F).


### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

In case the distribution of rewards to L2 stakers fails, the entire `Synthetix.mint()` should revert.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

None
