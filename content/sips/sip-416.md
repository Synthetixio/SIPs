## Simple Summary

This proposal aims to deprecate Synthetix's V3 deployment on Arbitrum. It involves transferring all funds from the [Core Contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xffffffaEff0B96Ea8e4f94b2253f31abdD875847) to the Treasury Gnosis safe. [Treasury](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf0288B07A9B9a49dbf9a2f584DB371093E8C14E2#readProxyContract) will then manage the subsequent distribution of these funds to users.

## Abstract

The deprecation entails:
- Transferring all funds held within the V3 Core Contract on Arbitrum to the Synthetix Treasury.
- Permanently disabling new deposits into the system and ensuring all subsequent withdrawal attempts are reverted.

## Motivation

The primary motivation is to complete the deprecation process for Synthetix V3 on Arbitrum. This deployment has been operating in a 'close-only' mode since the implementation of [SCCP-380](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-380/) in [January](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x16ed1a22b36c41e26f3081426bdc0c19440814afc87b5424df9cee451a4fc13f), and this SIP proposes the final steps to fully decommission it.


## Technical Specification

### Smart Contract Requirements

The [PR](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/pull/2377)  introduces a `deprecateCollateral()` function. 
The new function can be called by the contract owner and take two parameters: 
- `collateralType` being the address of the collateral being deprecated.
- `deprecationReceiver` being the address where the funds from the deprecated collateral will be sent. 

The latter function performs the following:
- The specified collateral type is marked as deprecated with an event.
- The collateral type is disabled, preventing any further deposits or other interactions with it within the V3 system.
- All existing funds of the deprecated collateral type held within the V3 Core Contract are transferred to the `deprecationReceiver` address.
- Withdrawal attempts by users are reverted
