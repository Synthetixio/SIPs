## Simple Summary

List [jupiter token](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/jupiter) (JUP) on Synthetix Perpetual Futures.

## Abstract

This proposal aims to list JUP perpetual futures on Synthetix Perps, allowing traders to gain exposure or hedge against JUP in the Synthetix ecosystem.

## Motivation

JUP is set to be listed on [binance](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-list-jupiter-jup-with-seed-tag-applied-7b5c643c3d8a4c9a9d443b1ceefb0015) on the 1st of February with a perp listing shortly after. This represents an opportunity to pull traders into the synthetix eco-system by being able to offer a trading venue for tokens that are sought after.

## Specification

JUP is still not available for trading, but it should have similar volume / liquidity depth specs to those seen for BONK.

### Technical Specification

Requires Pyth and Chainlink oracles.

### Test Cases

N/A

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

The specific configurable values related to the JUP listing, such as leverage limits, funding rates, and margin requirements, will be updated and maintained as per SCCP guidelines.
