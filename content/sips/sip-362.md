## Simple Summary

The sip proposes to put in place a new gas fee logic, which replaces the one currently implemented under [SIP-356](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-356/). The new implementation would incorporate the necessary changes in transaction costs associated with optimism's [ecotone upgrade](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/transactions/fees#ecotone). Depending on governance, base is expected to update their gas pricing mechanism on 18th of March. Therefore, this sip would be implemented immediately following the base update.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Implements the new gas price logic relies on the optimism documentation, where the cost of executing a transaction would be based on the below calculation:

```
costOfExecutionGross := (l2GasPrice * l2GasUnits + l1GasPrice * l2GasUnits)

where

l1GasPrice = 16*baseFeeScalar*baseFee + blobBaseFeeScalar*blobBaseFee
```
With the rest of the components in terms of obtaining the parameters from the [base gas contract](https://basescan.org/address/0x420000000000000000000000000000000000000F), the conversion to USD via the ETH/USD node, the upper and lower bounds on gas price compensation unchanged.

## Motivation

The main motivation is to update the protocol, as per the Ecotone specification in order to continue to incentivize keepers to perform keeping tasks.

## Specification

The changes laid out in this SIP are incorporated in PR's [2003](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/pull/2003/files) and [2011](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-v3/pull/2011).


## Test Cases

Will be setup after the testnet release.
