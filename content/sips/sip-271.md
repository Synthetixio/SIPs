## Simple Summary

In preparation for the ethereum merge event, expected to take place on [15-September](https://bordel.wtf/), this sip proposes to suspend all Synthetix contracts on both Ethereum and Optimism, 2 hours before the expected merge block and resume activites after ensuring that chainlink feeds and the rest of the protocol is in a stable state.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The system would be suspended by triggering the [`suspendSystem`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x696c905F8F8c006cA46e9808fE7e00049507798F#writeContract#F20) function wih the reason given being set to `271`.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

In order to ensure the smooth transition to the new network, the system would be suspended in preparation of the merge block and resumed on the new chain afer ensuring that all aspects of the protocol and price oracles are in a steady state. It is important to note, that the system will never be resumed on the PoW chain.

## Specification

The following checks would be performed on a forked chain (with [canon](https://usecannon.com/)) before unsuspending the system:
- Minting and burning debt can take place normally, with the debt pool oracle in line with size of debt
- Both atomic and non-atomic exchange tests would be performed to ensure that the outputted amounts are reasonable  
- Test on transfers of synths and snx to a different wallet
- Test on opening new loans with ETH and repaying that loan to release the ETH
- Test on opening futures positions,  modifying that position and closing that position to release the margin
- Test on flagging an account for liquidation and liquidating that account by moving forward in time
- ETH and LUSD can be wrapped and released
- LUSD price is close to 1$
- renBTC price is close to the price of BTC
- All chainlink oracles configured within synthetix are pushing prices that are within a reasonable margin from centralized exchange prices or off-chain calculated expected prices
