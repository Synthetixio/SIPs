## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes to remove the core fee capture mechanism (implemented per [SIP-319](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-319/)) in favor of market-level fee capture.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This change entails simplifying the codebase by removing the ability for fees to be captured on calls to `mintUsd`, `burnUsd`, `depositMarketUsd`, and `withdrawMarketUsd`. This fee capture mechanism has not yet been enabled on any Synthetix mainnet deployments via SCCP.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

A simple fee capture mechanism on stablecoin issuance/redemption was added to the core system, such that governance could configure a Synthetix deployment to share fees with parties other than liquidity providers. While this works well for the spot market implementation, the perpetual futures market implementations interface with the core system when escrowing margin collateral, not when processing trades. If the core fee switch were to be enabled on `depositMarketUsd` and `withdrawMarketUsd` globally, this would lead to undesired behavior on the perpetual futures market.

## Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

It would be possible to add an SCCP-configurable mapping of fee rate overrides on the core system, such that this fee could be disabled on specific markets like perpetual futures markets. This increases governance overhead. Alternatively, here we assume that fee capture can be enforced in the market implementations, especially as long as the `registerMarket` function remains permissioned to governance.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

The relevant updates should be applied to the `mintUsd`, `burnUsd`, `depositMarketUsd`, and `withdrawMarketUsd` functions. The storage slot used to track the fee amount can be renamed/commented (but not removed) to identify that it's currently unused and could be repurposed in the future.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Relevant tests will be developed during implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
