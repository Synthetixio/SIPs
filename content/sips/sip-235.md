## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Adds another require check to the `onlyTrustedMinters` modifier in `Issuer`.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "We propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

On each network, only one of those bridge addresses is the trusted contract and the other address has to be 0. Adding this check to the modifier will greatly increase the overall security of the system going forward.

## Motivation

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs? The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

To increase the security of this access control for future deployments.

### Technical Specification

#### `Issuer.onlyTrustedMinters`

We should patch this modifier to either only check the correct address for the chain it's on, or to check that one of the addresses == `address(0)`.

```
modifier onlyTrustedMinters() {
    require(
      msg.sender == resolver.getAddress(CONTRACT_SYNTHETIXBRIDGETOOPTIMISM) ||
      msg.sender == resolver.getAddress(CONTRACT_SYNTHETIXBRIDGETOBASE),
      "Issuer: Only trusted minters can perform this action"
    );
    require(
      resolver.getAddress(CONTRACT_SYNTHETIXBRIDGETOOPTIMISM) == address(0) ||
      resolver.getAddress(CONTRACT_SYNTHETIXBRIDGETOBASE) == address(0),
      "Issuer: One of the trusted minters is not 0"
    );
    _;
}
```
