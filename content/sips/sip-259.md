## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

There is a bug in `Issuer` which causes a subtraction overflow when `rateStalePeriod` setting is set greater than the current timestamp. To prevent issues when running tests,
fix the code so that it will allow any timestamp if `rateStalePeriod` is greater than current timestamp.

## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Though this fix has no effect on a live network (unless for some reason rate stale period was set too large by accident), this will make it much easier to test synthetix contracts
in a local network setting.
