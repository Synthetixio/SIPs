## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes a system for providing rewards (in addition to market performance) in Version 3 of the Synthetix protocol.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The proposed system allows pools to be connected to reward distributors by the pool’s owner using the rewards manager. This allows a token distribution to be provided across staking positions participating in the pool’s vaults (instantaneously or over time) pro-rata based on their amount of shares in the corresponding vault.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

This system creates a generic interface for incentivizing users to deposit collateral into specific vaults, in addition to any credit delegated to pool participants via markets. The rewards manager may be used to implement inflationary rewards, create preferential fee structures for specific collateral types, and more.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

First, a _rewards distributor_ must be created, which will payout rewards to the main Synthetix proxy address. Then, a pool owner must register this rewards distributor to their pool with the _rewards manager_. Users may then see the quantity of rewards available to them and claim them through the rewards manager.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

This system is appealing because it is very generic. This can essentially be used to create multiple instances of the original Staking Rewards contract functionality, and distribute multiple types of rewards on different schedules to users providing liquidity in specific ways. Technically, a payout could even entail a reward that isn't an ERC-20 token (such as non-transferrable 'points' in an external system). Note that this proposed system does not currently entail a mechanism for automatically depositing or locking rewarded tokens as collateral.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

#### Rewards Distributor

Reward distributors must conform to the IRewardDistributor interface. This only consists of `function payout(uint poolId, address token, address to, uint amount) external returns (bool);`. When called, it should mint and/or transfer amount of token to the to address. **For security reasons, this function should revert unless msg.sender is equal to Synthetix’s main proxy address.**

#### Rewards Manager

A pool owner can then connect a rewards distributor to their pool with the `distributeRewards()` function. The `poolId` and `collateralType` parameters identify the relevant vault. The `index` serves as an identifier for this distributor in relation to this vault. `distributor` specifies the address of the contract which implements the `IRewardDistributor` interface. amount indicates the total amount of tokens to be distributed starting at the start timestamp over duration seconds.

Note that `duration` may be set to 0, such that the rewards are distributed instantaneously based on the pro-rata distribution at start. Also, this function can be called again for the pool owner or from the address of the relevant distributor to update the parameters.

Anyone can call the `getAvailableRewards()` function to see what a particular account ID can claim from the distributors attached to a given vault. Then, an address than owns (or has relevant permissions on) that account can call the `claimRewards()` function. This, in turn, calls the `payout()` function on the rewards distributor with the appropriate amount.

Note that adding rewards distributors to a vault can increase gas usage for pool participants. Accordingly, only pool owners are allowed to add rewards distributors to the their vaults such that griefing attacks are preventable.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Relevant tests will be developed during implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
