## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes the introduction of the Core Contributor Committee (CCC) to help coordinate and govern the Core Contributors. The CCC will be comprised of existing Core Contributors elected to the role by the Core Contributors.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "We propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This SIP introduces the Core Contributor Committee which, if implemented, will be responsible for:

- Processing Core Contributor candidates and determining their engagement
- Managing Core Contributor incentive packages and compensations on a regular basis
- Managing and processing the removal of core-contributors where neccesary
- Managing resourcing within the CC budget and negotiating with the Treasury Council for setting this budget
- Managing external contributors and contractors - compensation, vesting allocation and trasition to CC's
- Overall decision making on behalf of CC's and their matters
- Collecting inputs from different departments on the process, resourcing and other
- Conduct regular 1-on-1s with CCs

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

The Core Contributors are a critical component to the Synthetix Protocol, ensuring the project has the resources for protocol development. Up until now, the structure of the Core Contributors has been very flat with most of the Core Contributors self-organizing and self-prioritizing protocol work.

This worked in the early stages of the protocol, where most of the Core Contributors worked in the same time-zones with only one or two SIPs being implemented in parallel, however as the number of CC's and SIPs has grown the lack of structure has impeded the scaling of the Synthetix Protocol.

The current structure of the Core Contributors also presents problems in the onboarding and compensation domains, where most of the processes are decided by a few individuals and are often opaque. This structure should be aligned with the rest of the Synthetix Governance system.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high-level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

The Core Contributor Committee will be made up of three members of the Core Contributors, elected by the Core Contributors. This committee decides (via a ⅔ majority) on a variety of decisions:

- Core Contributor Engagement/Disengagement
- Core Contributor Incentivization
- Core Contributor Resourcing & Prioritization
- Core Contributor Committee Stipends

#### Core Contributor Engagement/Disengagement

The on-boarding of new Core Contributors will be a process of coordination between the

- Core Contributors
- Core Contributor Committee members
- Treasury Council

These processes will be made transparent to the the community and other DAOs, with the omission of any information that the Core Contributor Committee deems sensitive.

_See [Test-Cases](#Test-Cases) for examples_

#### Core Contributor Incentivization

The Core Contributor Committee will be empowered and held responsible for conducting half-yearly reviews on the Core Contributors compensation and packages to provide a systematic way of ensuring that the Synthetix Protocol and Core Contributors are aligned.

During these haf-yearly reviews, the CCC will need to coordinate with the Treasury Council to adjust the CC budget.

From the specified budget they will also cover cost they believe to be necessary for the optimal performance of the Core Contributors.

_See [Test-Cases](#Test-Cases) for examples_

#### Core Contributor Resourcing & Prioritization

Core Contributors provide value in non-technical and technical ways, so the CCC will need to be diverse and enough to oversee both domains.

_SIPs_

The CCC may or may not be responsible for assigning leads from those interested in championing the SIPs who will be held accountable and responsible for leading a squad of resources (non-technical and technical) to implementing or perform feasibility assessments to that SIP.

Depending on the performance of the SIP lead and squad, the CCC may use its discretion to allocate additional bonuses for their work.

In terms of prioritization, the Core Contributors will be able to signal on a platform such as canny.io on which SIPs they think are most important, this will help foster a collaborative relationship between the Core Contributors and the CCC.

_Non-Technical Work_

Whilst SIPs are predominately for specifying technical protocol work, the non-technical work still remains an important aspect of running a successful protocol. The CCC will be responsible for scoping non-technical work in a similar fashion that is done with technical SIPs, this may require that there be non-technical leaders voted in for the Core Contributor Committee role.

#### Core Contributor Committee Stipends & Transparency

The Core Contributor Committee will be an incentivized role funded by the Treasury Council, the CCC stipends amounts will be openly shared - 1000 SNX. However, the amounts decided on by the Committee in regards to new and existing Core Contributors will remain accessible by only those involved internally. The CCC Stipends are made transparent so that the CC's have some sort of benchmark in understanding how the CCC are valuing their involvement with the Synthetix Protocol whilst avoiding conflict that may occur within the CC's if all the individual CC stipends were also shared.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs? The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The Core Contributor Committee ratification has been formed from a variety of considerations

_Voting System_

The CCC members are voted in by the Core Contributors as they are the ones who are directly influenced by the decisions that are being made, they are the ones who have the most context regarding which individuals would suit the role at a particular time. This results in a positively reinforced feedback system between the Core Contributors and the CCC members.

_Core Contributor Engagement_

The Core Contributor Committee is in the best position to understand which resources are lacking within the Core Contributors and the budget capacity while the existing Core Contributors themselves understand which candidates would be most suitable for the role they are applying for, this vouching system ensures that both parties are responsible for what they know best. This also applies for the disengagement of Core Contributors, since this Committee will be regularly interfacing with the CC's they will have the best understanding of performance.

_Core Contributor Compensation_

The CCC have full discretion over the budget provided by the Treasury Council so they are able to ensure that the Core Contributors incentives allocation is aligned with the Synthetix Protocol priorities defined by the Core Contributor Committee and Spartan Council.

### Technical Specification

#### Infrastructure

- Platform for voting on eligible candidates and record keeping on decision making
- Platform for voicing opinions on prioritization (such as Canny.io)
- Communication medium, such as a dedicated Discord channel or forum

#### Metagovernance

The Core Contributor Committee elections will happen every 6 months that may or may not be aligned with the other DAO bodies epoch elections in a transparent manner.

Election process will be set in a way to elect at least 1 person from engineering. Ideal split would be to have 1 engineering, 1 product & 1 marketing and other person.

### Test Cases

_Discretion in Budgeting_

The Core Contributor Committee has received their quarterly budget, upon review it is enough to meet the stipend required for the existing Core Contributors. However, the Core Contributor Committee is planning to hold a Core Contributor Off-Site at Main-net New York as well as sponsor it and realize that they need more funding for this particular quarter.

The Core Contributor Committee schedules a meeting with the Treasury Council in which they request more funding for partnerships and also ancillary cost. The Treasury Council obliges and schedules a transfer of funds to the Core Contributor Committee multi-sig.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)
