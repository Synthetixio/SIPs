## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes the introduction of the Core Contributor Committee to help coordinate and govern the Core Contributors. The CCC will be comprised of existing Core Contributors elected to the role by the other Core Contributors.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "We propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This SIP will introduce a new governance body called the Core Contributor Council, the CCC will be responsible for a number of functions currently managed by the synthetixDAO.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

The Core Contributors are a critical component of the Synthetix Protocol, introducing a formalised governance body elected by the Core Contribitors will ensure that Core Contributors are well coordinated and aligned with the other governing bodies of the protocol.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high-level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

- Voted in by either a Spartan Council or Core Contributors
- Define roadmap and priorities, handle compensation to core contributors, packages (salary and equity)
- Enforcing resources, since they handle the compensation they ensure that the core contributors are aligned and focussed on their task at hand
- Core contributors are able to non-bindingly signal what they think is important to be worked on out of the SIPs waiting to be done
- CCC also vouch for new hires and vote on the new hires

The Core Contributor Committee will be made up of three senior members of the Core Contributors, elected by the Core Contributors. This committee decides (via a ⅔ majority) what roles must be filled and proposes a budget to the Treasury Council each quarter. The CCC is then responsible for distributing funds for the aspects of the project listed below:

1. Core Contributor grants in sUSD and SNX
2. Core Contributor Discretionary bonuses
3. Core Contributor misc costs such as travel, work equipment and tooling
4. Office rents and other ancillary expenses
5. Major Partnership costs

_Core Contributor grants in sUSD and SNX_
The CCC negotiates individual Core Contributor grants and signing bonuses as well as escrow periods and other compensation. The CCC must ensure they stay within the budget negotiated with the TC at the start of each quarter.

_Core Contributor Discretionary bonuses_
The CCC disburses discretionary bonuses to Core Contributors based on exceptional performance. This discretionary bonus structure has existed since the early days of the project and has been a significant driver of alignment within the core contributors.

_Core Contributor misc costs such as travel, work equipment and tooling _
The CCC must ensure they have sufficient budget to pay for all CC ancillary costs like computers, software and travel.

_ Office rents and other ancillary expenses_
Any other costs required to support the CCs, including office rent and equipment must be allocated from the quarterly budget approved by the TC.

_Major Partnership costs_
Given historical precedent the CCC is best positioned to negotiate and manage external partnerships and relationships, these partnership costs can be requested from the TC on an ad hoc basis outside the approved quarterly budget if neccesary.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs? The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The SIP is designed to balance a number of considerations, but the primary reasoning behind establishing two new governance bodies rather than transferring these functions to existing governance systems or maintaining the status quo is to ensure that these critical functions are performed by community members elected specifically for their ability manage these functions. Separating these powers also ensures that there are checks and balances within the system of governance to ensure that all governance bodies are held accountable not only to token holders but to each other.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)
