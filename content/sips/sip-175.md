<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Divert a portion of the weekly SNX inflation to pay for protocol upgrades and maintenance.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The `protocolDAO` needs funds to pay for regular protocol upgrades and keeper functionality. This SIP proposes to divert `1,000` SNX weekly to the protocolDAO which can then convert it to Ether (approximately `3.5 ETH` p/w at time of writing) to pay for maintenance.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

The `sDAO` has been paying for upgrades and maintenance since inception of the protocol. Once the Synthetix treasury moves to the Treasury Council ([SIP-155](./sip-155.md)), having to request funds constantly for protocol maintenance through the Council will become more onerous.

The main need is for Ether to deploy and connect new iterations of the protocol on both L1 and L2. A secondary need is to maintain the current `DebtCache` keepers on both layers. The latter is too complex to be run by the Chainlink Keeper network (currently operating on the fee pool closing keeper) and is already marked as deprecated with [SIP-156](./sip-156.md). As such, a future SCCP will be planned to reduce this weekly amount, once the `DebtCache` keeper has been eliminated.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

As with other inflation diversion, this SIP requires an entry in `RewardsDistribution` for the protocolDAO to receive `1,000` each week of inflation.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

N/A

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

N/A

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

N/A

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
