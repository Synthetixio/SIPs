status:  Draft

type: Meta-Governance

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes minor amendments to the Core Contributor Committee (CCC) SIP-161 to help clarify CCCs responsibilties and only mentions modifications made to SIP-161.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "We propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This SIP clarifies the following Core Contributor Committee responsibilies, while keeping the original responsibilities in place:

- Former CCs will no longer be able to become a part of CCCs
- CCCs will no longer be managing the protocol road-map and vision this will be maanged by the SC
- CCCs will to manage Core Contributor and external Contributor incentive packages and compensations on a regular basis
- CCCs will be responsible for overall decision making on behalf of CCs and their matters
- CCCs will be collect input from different governance bodies and the community on the processes, resourcing and other feedback
- Conduct regular 1-on-1s with CC's and EC's
- Will act as the leadership body of the CCs and will be directly or indirectly responsible for execution of all their responsbilities

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

In addition to the original motivation for establishing the CCC, there is a need for leadership and management body for CCs to ensure all required work is being implemented in a timely and effective manner. The CCC is the overseeing body of the overall progress and the direct epresentative between the CCs and the community and other governing bodies. 

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high-level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

The Core Contributor Committee will consist of three Core Contributors, one from engineering and two from other specialisations. 

Amendments on the decisions to be made by CCCs:

- External Contributors will be added to the CCs Resourcing & Prioritization 
- Protocol Road-map and Vision is no longer a part of CCCs responsibilities
- CCCs are now a leadership and management body of CCs

#### Core Contributor Engagement/Disengagement

No change here.

#### Core Contributor Incentivization

CCCs are no longer to be eleceted every 3 months, they are now elected every 6 months, matching every second election epochs.
CCs compensations and packages are now to be reviewed at least every 6 months or earlier, instead of every 3 months. 

#### Core Contributor Resourcing & Prioritization

No change.

_SIPs_

All the original SIP-related responsibilites in SIP-161 are to be conducted directly or indirectly by the CCCs, meaning that CCCs may choose to delegate such responsibilites to an existing CC or determine that there is a lack of suitables CCs for particular roles and take necessary actions to fill the gaps. The goal of CCCs is to make sure that these responsibilites are implemented in a timely and effective manner one way or another.

_Non-Technical Work_

All the original non-technical work responsibilites in SIP-161 are to be conducted directly or indirectly by the CCCs, meaning that CCCs may choose to delegate such responsibilites to an existing CC or determine that there is a lack of suitables CCs for particular roles and take necessary actions to fill the gaps. The goal of CCCs is to make sure that these responsibilites are implemented in a timely and effective manner.

_Protocol Maintenance Work_

All the original protocol maintenance work responsibilites in SIP-161 are to be conducted directly or indirectly by the CCCs, meaning that CCCs may choose to delegate such responsibilites to an existing CC or determine that there is a lack of suitables CCs for particular roles and take necessary actions to fill the gaps. The goal of CCCs is to make sure that these responsibilites are implemented in a timely and effective manner.

#### Protocol Road-map and Vision

CCCs will no longer be responsible for protocol road-map and vision.

#### Core Contributor Committee Stipends & Transparency

CCCs are no longer to perform their duties with no compensation, they will now be paid a 1000 SNX monthly stipden per member

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs? The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The original rationalle for establishing the CCC was to have a governance body that was responsible for the CC's and could advocate on their behalf within the wider Synthetix governance framework. The intent was not for the individual members of the CCC to perform all of the takes and roles assigned to the CCC buyt in stead to provide oversight and monitoring of these takes and ensure that there were sufficient CC resources to enable these fucntions to be performed efficiently and effectiovely. THe CCC was also intinded to be an information conduit between the CC's and the other governance bodies within Synthetix to ensure that if a specific function assigned to the CC's was failing to be executed that the other governing bodies would have a place to discuss and resolve this issue. The intent is for the CCC to ensure that all CC tasks are properly resourced and manage and monitor the performance of each CC in their role.

#### Metagovernance

The Core Contributor Committee elections will no longer happen every epoch (3 months) aligned with the other governance bodies epoch length (currently set to 3 months), CCCs elections will happen every 6 months due to the nature of CCCs responsibilites and the requirement to be consistent with the budgets and other matters.

Additionally, the election process will be set in a way to elect at least 1 person from engineering in order to represent engineering CCs. An ideal split would be to have 1 engineering, 1 product & 1 marketing and/or other CC elected to cover a variety of responsibilities within the protocol.
