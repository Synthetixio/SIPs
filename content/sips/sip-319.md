## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes adding functionality for governance to set custom fee capture strategies when stablecoins are minted, burned, deposited, and withdrawn.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

The intent of this proposal is to provide governance with maximum flexibility in controlling fees where they may be levied by the core protocol.

## Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

By relying on a standardized interface for a smart contract to process fees, governance will be able to update the distribution of fees in addition to the amount of fees collected. The fee recipient could be a [rewards distributor](/sips/sip-305) or any other smart contract that implements a `collectFees(uint amount)` function.

## Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

Each of the `mintUsd`, `burnUsd`, `depositMarketUsd`, and `withdrawMarketUsd` functions will have a corresponding fee percentage value and fee recipient address.

On each of the actions, this percentage of stablecoins will be approved for transfer to the corresponding fee recipient address if present and then the `collectFees(uint amount)` will be called on the recipient address.

On mint and withdraw, fees will be effectively debited from LPs such that the exact amount specified by the caller is provided. The `getWithdrawableMarketUsd` function should be updated to take into account `withdrawMarketUsdFeePercentageD18`.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

- `uint depositMarketUsdFeePercentageD18`
- `address depositMarketUsdFeeRecipient`
- `uint withdrawMarketUsdFeePercentageD18`
- `address withdrawMarketUsdFeeRecipient`
- `uint mintUsdFeePercentageD18`
- `address mintUsdFeeRecipient`
- `uint burnUsdFeePercentageD18`
- `address burnUsdFeeRecipient`
