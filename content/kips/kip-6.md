## Summary

A proposal outlining a framework for a sub-DAO that fosters open community development.  

## Abstract

The devDAO would enable community members to resolve bugs, improve features, or create new features for the Kwenta platform with appropriate rewards for contributions. 

## Motivation

By opening development to the Kwenta community, not only will the DAO accelerate progress but it will also gain resiliency as Core Contributors become less of a crux for product development. To achieve full decentralization, open development is essential. 

## Specification

The devDAO requires an interface where community developers can monitor open tickets with their associated reward, the Core Contributors will be responsible for providing a board. A reward would only be given to a community developer in the event that a pull request for a given ticket was evaluated by an Auditor and merged by a Core Contributor. 

**Community PM:** An individual that prepares tickets and handles project management for community-driven initiatives. This individual works directly with Core Contributors as well as community members to create and manage tickets, assess pull requests, support the Kwenta development community, and communicate community needs to Core Contributors. The Kwenta Community PM will receive a compensation package managed by the Core Contributor Committee along with Core Contributor privileges. The Community PM will determine if a KIP or external audit is required for a ticket to reach the completed phase. Tickets that require a KIP will be determined by whether they are cosmetic or product-level changes. Tickets that require external audits will be managed in collaboration with Core Contributors and the DAO will be responsible for covering audit costs. The PM can reserve tickets for individuals if they are confident that the developer can execute on the ticket. 

**Bounty Hunter:** Individuals that take on entry-level tickets. 

**Kwenta Community Dev:** Vetted individuals that routinely take on intermediate to advanced tickets. These individuals are eligible for recurring compensation in addition to ticket bounty rewards, adding an element of security to their position. Recurring compensation will be issued by the Core Contributor Committee in the form of sUSD. As trusted individuals who have proven that they can deliver quality work, higher-level tickets will be reserved for them along with higher tiers of rewards. 

**Auditors:** An Auditor will review code prior to it being merged to ensure there are no bugs and that the code meets Kwenta community standards. Rewards for auditors will be determined by the Kwenta Community PM on a case-by-case basis. Auditors can be trusted community members given the role by the Community PM, Kwenta Community Devs that were not responsible for writing the code being audited, or Core Contributors. For a ticket to pass the auditing phase, both a community Auditor and Core Cntributor must have audited and approved the code. 

**Rewards & Compensation:** Rewards are issued in the form of Kwenta inflationary rewards which vest over a period of one year but can be staked while vesting to capture more rewards as well any fees/bonuses available.

Compensation structure (These values are approximate, rewards are ultimately determined by Community PM and CCCs) 
Entry-level tickets - 0.25-3 KWENTA 
Intermediate-level tickets - 3-10 KWENTA
Advanced-level tickets - 10+ KWENTA 
Recurring compensation packages - 1k-16k sUSD/Month + Packages can include locked KWENTA for long-term engagements

KWENTA will be issued with a 1 year lock-up period unless otherwise specified.
