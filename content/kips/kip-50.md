## Summary

This KIP proposes a second month long liquidity mining trial between Uniswap & Velodrome.

## Abstract

[KIP-46](https://kips.kwenta.io/kips/kip-46/) and [KIP-49](https://kips.kwenta.io/kips/kip-49/) introduced a liquidity mining trial to compare Velodrome and Uniswap. This KIP aims to introduce a second iteration of that trial with updated levels of incentives to test.

## Motivation

The first test wasn't a true A/B test because the incentives for each pool's liquidity mining program were different. This KIP aims to create a second test where each pool has the same amount of liquidity to make a comparison easier.

The first test was a trial of Velodrome's liquidity mining program.  The results of the first test can be found [here](assets/KIP50VeloUniComparison.pdf). Velodrome attracted roughly ~50% more TVL per 1 $KWENTA of incentives than Uniswap.  This test will decrease the total incentives allocated to liquidity mining from 587.57375 to 400 split 50/50 instead of 66/33. 

## Specification

 - Allocate 50 $KWENTA per week to the Velodrome pool for one month.
 - Allocate 50 $KWENTA per week to the Uniswap pool for one month.
