# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes open the account merge window for 30 days on optimism.

# Abstract

The account merge window is not currently open on optimism, opening entails setting the `accountMergingDuration` to 30 days and executing the `startMergingWindow` afterwards.

# Motivation

The main motivation is that certain users are looking to move their escrow snx into different accounts. This SCCP caters for that request.
