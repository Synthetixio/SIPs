# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to increase the `maxTokenAmount` to 6k `sETH` from 2k `sETH` 

# Abstract

The `maxTokenAmount` is the maximum possible amount of tokens that can be minted from a given wrapper by depositing the underlying, `wETH`.

# Motivation

The proposed changes in this SCCP is part of a suite of pre-requisite changes done, in order to facilitate migration of spot synths on L1 as specified in [SIP-2059](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-2059/) and unwinding of the debt pool skew.
