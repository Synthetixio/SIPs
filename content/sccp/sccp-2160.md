# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to increase the `snxUSD` wrapper cap to 3 million sUSD from 1 million.

# Abstract

Wrappers can be updated by calling `setWrapperMaxTokenAmount` under the [`SystemSettings`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x202ae40Bed1640b09e2AF7aC5719D129A498B7C8#writeContract) contract. 

# Motivation

The motivation behind this sccp is to allow Treasury to get more sUSD from their holding of snxUSD.
