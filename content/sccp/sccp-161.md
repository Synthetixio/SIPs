## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Increase the inflationary rewards on L2 to 100K snx from 75K snx per week.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

In order to further incentivize minters to shift their holdings to L2, this sccp proposes to increase inflationary rewards on L2 to 100k snx per week.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
This SCCP aims to further incentivize minters to move their stack to L2. Current staking rewards are at all-time lows on L2, and this SCCP seeks to align staking rewards on L1 and L2 by increasing inflationary rewards.

Increasing inflationary rewards on L2 helps to bridge the gap between the timing between debt synthesis and current low L2 rewards.
