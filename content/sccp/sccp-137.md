## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Lower target c-ratio on L2 from 900% to 750%

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

As laid out in SCCP 96, we intend to steadily reduce c-ratio as needed to minimize pain to stakers.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

We observe that the peg on uniswap is ~1.07 synth-non synth. There is significant new demand from the launch of Lyra that we would like to meet.

750% is chosen because there are still several significant risks in this early stage of the trading rollout. It is also part of our three prong plan for more liquidity on L2.
