## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SCCP proposes to increase the LUSD wrappr cap to 30 million sUSD on L2.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

In order to begin the process of transitioning away from DAI Wrappr and provide synth liquidity to optimism, this sccp proposes to raise the cap on the LUSD wrappr to 30 million sUSD.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Raising the cap on the LUSD wrappr will increase synth liquidity on optimism and allow us to transition away from relying on the DAI wrappr as the major on-ramping tool.
