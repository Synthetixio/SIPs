## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

This SCCP proposes to configure `0xa09550489FF57fF4192cA14345ea3ED126B00492` as an integrator in the perps v3 system. 

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

The configuration will ensure that 20% of trading fees are sent to integrators at every trade. 

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The main motivation is to configure the system as to incentivize the new integrator, Ezbot, to provide bring volume to perps v3.
