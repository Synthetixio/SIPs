# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to deprecate EOS market in light of the upcoming rebrand to [`A`](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/detail/1e89a9ca957c4b0ca7502e60b993e201).

# Abstract

Removing these market entails setting the OI cap to zero and updating the price feed to the constant price (the latest available EOS market).


# Motivation

The motivation is the gradual deprecation of low utilization markets on V3, as Synthetix shifts focus to its roadmap priorities and reallocates resources away from legacy products.
