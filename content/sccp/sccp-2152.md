# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes deprecate the FTM market on optimism by first setting the oi cap to zero and deprecating the market completely on the 13th of January. The sUSD margin would be sent to Treasury allowing users to reclaim that margin by opening a ticket on discord.

# Abstract

OI cap is lowered to zero by setting the `maxMarketValue` parameter to zero. The markets are then deprecated by calling the `removeMarketByKey` function with the argument `sFTMPERP`.

# Motivation

The main motivation is given the rebrand and token swap which is expected to cause issues as oracle providers switch over to new feeds.
