# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes implement the following:
- Lower the `issuanceRatio` to 1 wei
- Lower the `minimumStakeTime` to 1 second

# Abstract

The `issuanceRatio` determines the amount of leverage a snx staker would be able to get on his position. Lowering the `issuanceRatio` to 1 wei would effectively disable ability of stakers to borrow sUSD against deposited SNX.
The `minimumStakeTime` is the minimum amount of time that should elapse after staking, in order to be able to exit the system. Given that staking on v2x on optimism would be disabled this parameter can be set to the minimum.

# Motivation

The main motivation is the upcoming release related to [SIP-420](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-420/) with the above changes needed in order to facilitate the transition.
