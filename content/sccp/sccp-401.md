## Simple Summary

Liquidations will be turned back for both mainnet and optimism stakers. Staker liquidations will return to 160% for both mainnet and optimism.

## Abstract

Liquidations have always been an important part of maintaining system health/solvency. This SCCP proposes to return the liquidation ratios to their naturak level (i.e. 160%). 

## Motivation

[SCCP 396](https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-396/) paused liquidations during a period of early testing/whitelisting to ensure that non-whitelisted stakers were not unfairly subject to liquidations. As stated in SCCP 396 - "Once the migration period has been publicly available for a period deemed long enough for everyone to have had the chance to enter the 420 pool (circa 2 weeks), liquidations will be turned back on on both Ethereum mainnet and Optimism."

Now that the 420 pool has been live for over 2 weeks, giving people ample opportunity to migrate, liquidations will be turned back on to ensure system health and to avoid bad debt accruing.
