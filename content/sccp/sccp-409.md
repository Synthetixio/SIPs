# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to increase the jubilee ratio (sUSD deposited in the 420 pool : Original debt in the 420 Pool) to 20%.

# Abstract

The parameters from (SIP-421)[https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-421/] being updated are described below;
- Jubilee minimum ratio (`auxTokenInfo`) is being increased from 10% to 20%

# Motivation

Whilst the initial 10% was effective to get it to $0.96, this is not enough, the peg needs to return to above $0.99. The initial 10% configuration proved highly effective in supporting the sUSD peg, with 75% of stakers holding over 10,000 sUSD in debt meeting the requirement. Consequently, sUSD has stabilized at approximately $0.96 for about one week. While the 10% configuration successfully raised the peg to $0.96, further measures are necessary to restore it to $1.00.
