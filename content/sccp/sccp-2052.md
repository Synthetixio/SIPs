# Simple Summary

This SCCP proposes to increase the ETH Max Market Value from 31,000 ETH to 36,000 ETH (i.e. by 7.5m$ increase).

# Abstract

The `MaxMarketValue` is the maximum possible open interest on any given side of a perp market.

# Motivation

The main motivation is the high utilization of the ETH perp market which is close of 80% capacity. 
It is worth highlighting that the maximum capacity of all the crypto volatile pools is currently around 174m$, compared to a total debt pool size of 115m$.
