## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->
This SCCP proposes the following parameters for the LUSD wrapper on Optimism:
- Set the `burnFeeRate`to 5%.
- Set the `mintFeeRate` to 5bp,
- Set the `maxTokenAmount` to $10m.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

The `maxTokenAmount` is the max amount allowed to be used to issue a synth with a underlying specified in the wrapper contract, in this case it's LUSD.
The `burnFeeRate` determines the fee that is paid when burning sUSD to release the wrapped underlying.
The `mintFeerate` determines the fee that is paid when minting sUSD by wrapping the underlying.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Although the LUSD wrapper was originally unwrapped due to persistent peg issues and to prepare for the transition to v3, some large traders have expressed interest in using our perps product and suggested that they are unable to onboard due to slippage incurred on sUSD. With LUSD more tightly pegged in recent months and still several months likely until the launch of Perps v3 to mainnet, a wrapper expansion would provide an alternative route for these traders to try Synthetix Perps. $10m capacity should be sufficient for at least one large trader to onboard using LUSD and could be expanded again if capacity filled quickly.
