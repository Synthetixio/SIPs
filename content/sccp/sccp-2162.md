# Abstract

Removing these market entails removing them from `FuturesMarketManager` contract.  In parallel, the margin locked up in this contract will be sent treasury who in their turn handle the disbursement to the relevant traders.


# Motivation

The motivation is the gradual deprecation of low open interest markets on V2, as Synthetix shifts focus to its roadmap priorities and reallocates resources away from legacy products.
