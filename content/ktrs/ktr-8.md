## Address

## Rationale

The adminDAO proposes that the Kwenta Treasury transfer fifty thousand sUSD for incidental Kwenta expenditures. The adminDAO has under its purview most DAO roles, including DAO Contributors, Product Elites, marketingDAO, and devDAO. The requested funds will be utilized to reimburse Core Contributors, cover offsites & Kwenta event expenses, various subDAO expenses, bonuses for DAO roles, and other expenditures. 

The adminDAO will be able to run autonomously and sustainably with 50,000 sUSD in quarterly funding. In the unlikely event that more than 50k sUSD is required in a quarter, the adminDAO can submit a separate request for funds.

As the protocol evolves, it will become more burdensome to regularly seek payments for contributor costs through the treasuryDAO. We propose that the Kwenta treasury deliver quarterly replenishments of $50,000 sUSD. 

The adminDAO offers a transparent and decentralized process to manage administrative responsibilities across the protocol. The adminDAO will be responsible for tracking costs and reporting the use of funds on a quarterly basis to the treasuryDAO. Quarterly records provide an opportunity for oversight and prevent excessive spending.
