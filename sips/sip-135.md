## Simple Summary

Deploy sUSD shorts for sETH and sBTC onto L2.

### Overview

Refactor and optimise the L1 shorting mechanism to be deployable on Optimism.

### Rationale

There is currently no plan to deploy iSynths onto L2. This means that L2 users will not be able to access inverse price exposure.

The shorting mechanism on L1 has around $50m of open interest on shorts. However, transactions are expensive, making the mechanism unviable for smaller trades.

Deploying this mechanism onto L2 will solve both of the above problems.

It will also enable new projects to be launched, demonstrating the power of composability on L2.

### Technical Specification

The mechanism for shorting is described in SIP 103. The majority of work in this SIP is around reducing code size to conform with OVM requirements.

It also proposes some improvements to the UX, namely:

Allow users to deposit collateral and increase their short in 1 transaction.
Allow users to repay their short and withdraw collateral in 1 transaction.

We are also proposing to remove the interaction delay for loans. We are weighing the potential of front running with the attack vector of opening and closing positions during the interaction delay period. TODO - DG get better clarification on why we are removing this.

To combat front running potential we've discussed adding fee reclamation with a setting that is off by default and that can be turned on later, however we feel this will significantly delay the launch as that will take some time to integrate as that logic does not exist in the existing shorts contracts. This is an open question still of how we want to mitigate against front running techniques.

```
function open(uint collateral, uint amount, bytes32 currency) external returns (uint id);

function close(uint id) external;

function depositAndDraw(uint id, uint drawAmout, uint depositAmount) external;

function repayAndWithdraw(uint id, uint repayAmount, uint withdrwaAmount) external

function liquidate(address borrower, uint id, uint amount) external;
```

### Test Cases

Unit tests included with implementation for combining the deposit / draw and withdrawal / repay functions.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

Adding shorting against other synth assets beyond just sETH and sBTC. Will be proposed via an SCCP.
