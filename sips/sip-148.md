## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes a modification to the existing liquidation mechanism defined in SIP-15, the purpose is to reduce the likelihood of cascading liquidations leading to a destabilisation of the stability mechanisms.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

1) Allow the protocol to mint sUSD to liquidate delinquent accounts internally to the protocol.
2) Add a function to instantly liquidate a delinquent account if it falls below specified c-ratio configurable via SCCP (150% initially)
3) Add a function to liquidate accounts that fall and remain below a specified c-ratio for more than n days configurable via SCCP (3 initially)
4) Add a funtion to self liquidate at any time below the target c-ratio
5) All three liquidation functions will have a liquidation penalty applied, configurable via SCCP (20%, 10% and 3% initially)
6) A liquidation pool will be created where liquidated SNX will be sent and distributed based on the instantaneous debt distribution at the time of the liquidation, using the debt register entry as the basis for the claims.
7) SNX liquidated and claimed from the liquidation pool will be added to the stakers escrow balance and locked for 12 months as per other claims.


## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

As we have seen with the liquidations on 10-11 June 2021, there is a possibility for liquidations to have substantial market impact and if they start a cascade of new accounts getting flagged, which causes people to fear more liquidations, which causes more selling, which causes more fear of liquidations, this could result in a catostrophic failure of the system leading to losses by synth holders.

Moreover, users are not perfectly incentivized to restore their c-ratio in some cases, as they essentially hold a free put option, which could be very valuable in times of market stress. Accounts with very large stakes may also believe that they are unable to sell their SNX without incurring more than 10% slippage, which may make walking away and eating the liquidation preferable. Fear from this liquidation of large accounts could also lead to substantial adverse market impact in the leadup to the event. 

The goal is 1) to more heavily incenvitize stakers to act in the best interests of the system during times of stress, 2) to lower uncertainty about bad debt for synth holders and make it clear that SNX holders are the ultimate backstop for the system, 3) to remove forced liquidations at inopportune times and encourage insolvent stakers to explore other options such as self liquidating in order to avoid costly penalties.

This redeisgned liquidation mechanism creates much better incentive aligment within the system by providing options for stakers to repair their c-ratio with a minimal penalty if they are unable or unwilling to buy Synths on market to restore their ratio. It also ensures that in extreme scenarios liquidations happen instantly without creating a negative feedback loop on the price of SNX. It relaxes the current liquidation mechanism and relies more on self-liquidation and the backstop of instant liquidation for protecting system solvency. Fundamentally it creates several layers of penalties that transfer owneership of the protocol from ineffficnt stakers to more efficient stakers, this combined with the existing incentives to repair ratios should result in a more responsive and stable network collateralisation ratio.


## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

A new contract will be deployed that will receive SNX liquidated using any of the three new liquidation functions. This SNX will be assigned to stakers based on their instantaneous debt % at the time of the liquidation using the debt register entry to retrospectively calculate the percentage of the debt pool at the time of the liquidation event. The protocol will mint new sUSD to liquidate positions and burn the debt of the deliquent account with a fixed liquidation reward in SNX paid to keepers who perform functions within the liquidation suite.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

TBD

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

### Test Cases

TBD
