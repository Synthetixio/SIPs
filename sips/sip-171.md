## Simple Summary
After an exchange the total balance of the destination synths is locked for `waitingPeriodSecs` seconds. This SIP proposes to modify the lock to instead only lock the exchange `amountReceived` balance, and not the full address balance.

## Abstract
This SIP will lock only the `amountReceived` in the destination address after an exchange instead of the full address balance.

## Motivation
Allowing only partial locks allows AMM's such as curve, dodo, sushiswap to be modified to accept the balance and immediately allow a subsequent swap, any rebate will be profit for the pool LPs

### Rationale
Atomic synth swaps
