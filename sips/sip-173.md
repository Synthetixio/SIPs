This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor.

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Create and deploy a `SynthUpgrader` contract allowing the `protocolDAO` to easily upgrade the underlying `Synth.sol` logic contract in a single atomic transaction.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Following the success of contract-based migrations in [SIP-151](./sip-151.md), this SIP proposes a `SynthUpgrader` migration contract to more easily handle the various aspects of a synth's logic upgrade and to avoid system downtime. This includes removing the old synth, adding the new one, updating its token state and proxy, along with the address resolver. This SIP also proposes supporting migration in batches, rather than a single synth at a time, to more easily complete the process.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

There are a number of reasons to replace a synth's logic contract outside of a regular deploy. The most common is when a synth is marked for delisting and requires purging, but the synth is not purgeable. This is relevant in the case of both [SIP-166](./sip-166.md) and [SIP-169](./sip-169.md) as the long synths mentioned in both SIPs are not marked as purgeable. Currently there exists a command to do this in the synthetix repo - requiring at least 6 protocolDAO transactions per synth. Moreover, because the transactions are not atomic<sup>[1]</sup>, the system currently needs suspension to perform the replacements, which cause disruption to regular users and exchanges.

This SIP proposes leveraging the work begun with migration contracts in [SIP-151](./sip-151.md) by creating a reusable and permissioned `SynthUpgrader` contract.

> 1. To replace a synth, the `totalSupply` needs to be set to `0` in order for it to be removed from the sytem however the new synth needs to track the same `totalSupply`. If we don't upgrade synths atomically, any issuing or burning of a synth's supply (via an exchange) that happens in between fetching and persisting the `totalySupply` can lead to data corruption - hence why in the past we've opted to suspend the system.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

The creation of a custom and reusable `SynthUpgrader` contract that allows the batch upgrades of synths.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

Unlike [SIP-151](./sip-151.md), the logic of upgrading a synth is consistent and fairly intricate (requiring custom code and predicates that the `generate-solidity` command isn't able to reproduce). Thus, it makes sense to deploy a reusable `SynthUpgrader` contract which requires the new Synth contract be predeployed and only allow execution from the `protocolDAO`.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

```solidity
interface ISynthUpgrader {
    // Restricted to owner
    function upgrade(bytes32[] calldata synthContractLabels, address[] calldata newSynths) external;
}
```

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

- When `upgrade` is invoked by a non-owner, Then the transaction reverts
- When `upgrade` is invoked by the owner with a label that doesn't exist, Then the transaction reverts
- When `upgrade` is invoked by the owner with a label for a contract that isn't a synth, Then the transaction reverts
- When `upgrade` is invoked by the owner with a synth that has a different currency key, token state or proxy to the existing synth, Then the transaction reverts
- When `upgrade` is invoked by the owner otherwise, Then it replaces all synths given

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
