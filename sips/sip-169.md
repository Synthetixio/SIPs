## Simple Summary
This SIP proposes to deprecate a number of L1 Synths as we move closer to launching L2.    The proposed Synths are generating low volumes for the network with most having high exchange fees on L1 and add various front running and other risk factors which can be better solved for on L2  

The Synths to be deprecated include s1INCH, sAAVE, sGOOG, sAMZN, sAAPL, sADA, sCOIN, sCOMP, sCRV, sDASH, sEOS, sETC, sFTSE, sFB, sLTC, sMSFT, sXMR, sNFLX, sNIKKEI, sDOT, sREN, sXRP, sRUNE, sTRX, sTSLA, sXTZ, sUNI, sYFI, sGBP, sCHF, sJPY, sKRW, sBNB

Once deprecated each asset can be re-evaluated and then launched on L2 as per SIP-121.

## Abstract
This SIP will remove synths from the L1 contracts by pausing exchanges into all the proposed Synths then purging holders into sUSD.

Once all holders are purged, the debt pool and Synthetix protocol will be updated to remove references to corresponding Synths on L1.


## Motivation
With the imminent launch of Synth trading on L2 the requirement to maintain a comprehensive list of L1 Synths becomes less desirable.  Many of the listed Synths can be exploited in ways that are detrimental to Stakers.  Soft front running and spot manipulation have been identified as practical attack vectors the protocol has been dealing with on L1. Front running issues also cause the exchange fee on many of these Synths to be high and adds an unnecessary perception that Synthetix is a prohibitively expensive protocol to use for exchanging assets.  
  
More recently the project has been discussing the focus on L2 as the primary environment for trading Synths, while keeping a handful of more liquid L1 Synths for larger composability opportunities.  
The Synths that would continue to be available, traded and utilized (including through various integrations) are sUSD, sETH, sBTC, sLINK, sDEFI, sCEX (converting to sCEFI), sEUR and sAUD. 
Reducing surface area during this transition to L2 will minimise chances of an exploit, accelerate the shift to a better, faster trading experience and refine the protocol’s focus on desirable Synths.


## Specification and Overview 
Phase 1: Purge and remove Synths
Pause exchanges on all Synths.
Upgrade synths to PurgeableSynths that allows synths to be purged into sUSD.
Purge remaining synth holders and remove Synths from the Synthetix pricing exchangeRates contract.


### Rationale
Splitting the deprecation of Synths into two phases allows the Synths to be purged and removed from Kwenta first, and then have contract updates to be done as a separate release
