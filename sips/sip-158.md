This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor.

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

This SIP proposes to deprecate inverse synths in favour of the shorting mechanism introduced in [SIP 103](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-103). Once this SIP is implemented and iSynths are removed from the protocol a planned upgrade of Multi-collateral shorts will allow for more assets to be added to the shorting mechanism.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

This SIP will remove inverse synths from the protocol by pausing exchanging into all inverse Synths then purging holders into sUSD.

Once all holders are purged, the contracts will be updated to remove references to iSynths and inverse pricing will be removed from the exchangeRates contract.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

With the introduction of shorting in Multi-collateral loans [SIP 103](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-103) the ability to open natural shorts on ETH and BTC was introduced without using iETH or iBTC.

The ongoing mangaement of iSynths requires manual intervention by the pDAO to purge all holders and reset them each time they freeze. The design of the inverse synths pricing also introduced leverage as they reached their upper / lower limits, which required exchange fees to be increased to deal with frontrunning.

Upgrades to the multi-collateral loan and shorts contracts on L1 will enable shorting on a wider range of assets, starting with the top ten traded Synths by volume.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->
### Overview

### Technical Specification

### Phase 1: Purge and remove Inverse Synths

1. Pause exchanges on all iSynths.
2. Purge remaining isynth holders and remove iSynths from the Synthetix and inverse pricing exchangeRates contract.
3. Ensure Collateral Manager continues to open loans and shorts with isynths supply at 0.

### Phase 2: Upgrade contracts to remove Inverse Synths

After delisting and removing iSynths, references to inverse Synths and pricing can be removed from:

1. exchangeRates contract
2. CollateralManager contract (Upgrade as part of the Multicollateral loan updates)

This would require a release to remove the references to inverse pricing and use of inverse Synths from these contracts.

## Rationale

Splitting the deprecation of iSynths into two phases allows the isynths to be purged and removed from Synthetix exchange first, and then have contract updates to be done as a separate release.

### Test Cases

### Configurable Values
